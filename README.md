LifeItUp - The Open Source Admin Panel
===============

A system panel using Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5, Less and Jquery. Free to use, even commercially :), but, as long as you give a link back to me to cynt.co.nf with my name please (Cynthia Sanchez).

<h4>Online demo</h4>
<a href='http://cyntss.github.io/Lifeitup-panel/'>LifeItUp - open source UI</a>
<hr>
<h4>Run it in a http local server</h4>
Use the fastest http server with python.
In your console, go to the folder where you have LifeItUp and then run:

<code>python -m http.server 8000</code>

To see the site working simply open a browser and go to <a href='http://localhost:8000'>http://localhost:8000</a>
